Polymorphism :

Poly : many 
polymorphism : many form

In OOPS, polymorphism refers to a method/function/operator to perform differently in different situation.

built-in function :

len() : 

string : If we use this len() in string, it will give the number of characters in a string.

s = input("Enter your string") 
print("Length of the string is :", len(s))

list : If we use this len() in list, it will give the number of values stored in the list.

l = [12, 23, 34, 57, 43, 54]
print("The no. of values in the list : ", len(l))

dictionary : If we use this len() in dict, it will give the number of key:value pair in the dict.

d = { name : "Aptech",
      location : "Nayapalli",
      course : ['Python', 'MySQL', 'Data Science', 'MERN', 'MEAN']
    }
print(len(d)) 

This is one type of polymorphism. 

Oops mostly deals with classes and object. Polymorphism is also used in classes.


class Car:
  brand = ''
  model = ''
  def __init__(self, b, m):
    self.brand = b
    self.model = m
  def move(self):
    print("Drive")

class Boat:
  brand = ''
  model = ''
  def __init__(self, b, m):
    self.brand = b
    self.model = m
  def move(self):
    print("Sail")

class Plane:
  brand = ''
  model = ''
  def __init__(self, b, m):
    self.brand = b
    self.model = m
  def move(self):
    print("Fly")


c = Car('Suzuki', 'Fronx')
c.move()   # Drive

b = Boat('Xyz' , 'Pqr')
b.move()   # Sail

p = Plane('Indigo', 'Spicejet')
p.move() # Fly


In the above example, the move() is behaving differently for different class. Hence it is polymorphism. 

Polymorphism also used in inheritance. 

class Vehicle: 

  brand = ''
  model = ''
  def __init__(self, b, m):
   self.brand=b
   self.model = m
  def move(self):
   print("Drive")


class Car(Vehicle):
  pass

class Boat(Vehicle):
   def move(self):
    print("Sail")

class Plane(Vehicle):
   def move(self):
    print("Fly")

c = Car('Suzuki', 'Fronx')
c.move()   # Drive

b = Boat('Xyz' , 'Pqr')
b.move()   # Sail

p = Plane('Indigo', 'Spicejet')
p.move() # Fly

This is also polymorphism.
