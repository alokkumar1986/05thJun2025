Data Visualisation :

When we have a lots of data, we can not take decision by simply seeing the data. Hence we need something that will represent data in picture or chart or graph, so that we can simple see the chart or picture and make decision. The process of creating charts/ graphs/ pictures from data is called data visualisation.

In python, we can plot 2-D graphs using matplotlib.

matplotlib is a python module/ library using which we can plot different types of graphs/ charts.

1) line graph
2) bar chart
3) histogram
4) pie chart
5) heap chart etc.

Steps to create a simple chart :

1) Installing matplotlib
2) Import matplotlib and its submodule pyplt
3) use of plot()
4) use of show()


Installing matplotlib
#==================+++

pip list
 or
pip show matplotlib

We can check whether matplotlib is installed or not in the system

if not,

pip install matplotlib

John D hunter is the father of matplotlib. He wrote this library in the year 2003.


Import matplotlib and its submodule pyplot 
#=======================================

form matplotlib import pyplot as plt


Use plot() 
#====================

plt.plot(x, y, "color")


x = list of points in the x-axis
y = list of points in the y-axis

color = "r", "o"

Use show()
#======================

plt.show()

This method is used to show the graph that is plotted using plot()


example :

from matplotlib import pyplt as plt

x = [0, 2, 4, 6]
y = [1, 3, 5, 7]

plt.plot(x, y)

plt.show()


pyplot : It is submodule of matplotlib in which we have different methods to create a graph.


color : It is the color of the line joining two points (marker)


linestyle : It is style of the line joining two markers.

dotted
dashed
-
--

marker : It is the meeting point/ point in the graph

o
*
v
^
<
>

markersize : It is the size of the marker. 


linewidth : It is the width of the line joining two marker.

mec : marker edge color - It is the border color of the marker.


mfc : marker font color - it is the color of the marker


title() : It adds title to a graph

xlabel() : It adds a label to x-axis

ylabel() : It adds a label to y-axis
