PIP : 

PIP stands for 'Package Installer for Python'.


It comes automatically when we installed python in our system.

using pip we can install / uninstall any built-in packages in our system.

There are huge numbers of packages available for python.

Package : It is a folder containing various python files. Each python file may contain one or more methods / functions. These files are called modules. In the package directory, there must be a __init__.py file. This __init__.py must contain the description/ definition / declaration various modules available in that packages.

Module : It is a python file with functions/ objects.

Module as an alias. 


how to add a module :

import moduleName 

#whole module is imported

import moduleName as aliasName 

# whole module is imported

from moduleName import function/methodName as function/methodaliasName  

#specifically import a single function from a module 





add.py 
=================
def add(x, y):
  return x+y

def substract(x,y):
  return x-y


cal.py (import a module)
=================
import add as a

print("Addition of 10 & 20 : " , a.add(10,20))
print("Substarction of 10 & 20 : " , a.substarct(10,20))

cal1.py (import function from a module)
=========================
from add import add as a, substarct as s

print("Addition of 10 & 20 : " , a(10,20))
print("Substarction of 10 & 20 : " , s(10,20))


add is a module created by us. random is a built-in module.
built-in modules are available in build-in packages. 

pip install packageName
pip uninstall packageName

pip list / pip freeze 

#list of packages installed in the system

pip search packageName

Q) If all the packages are installed in my system, what will happen?

All the packages will be available all the projects in the system. Project size will increase. Performance may hamper.

To handle such situation, we use virtual environment. 

1)How to create a virtual environment :

py -m venv env1 

#env1 : Name of the virtual environment

2) How to activate virtual environment

activate.bat

============================================

How to create a package ?


step 1 : create a folder (calculate)
step 2 : create __init__.py inside calculate folder
step 3 : create module inside calculate folder

   add1.py  
   substract1.py  

step 4 : list the module in __init__.py file

from .add1 import add
from .substract1 import substract


Now we can use this calculate package in any program

53.py
===========

from calculate import add

print("Addition of 10 and 20 :" add(10,20))
