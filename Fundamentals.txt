Fundamentals :


1) comments

    singleline  #
    multiline   '''/"""

2) identifiers

3) keywords 

There are 33 keywords in python  / 35 keywords (async, await)

True, False, None 
and, or, not, is 
if, elif, else
while, for, break, continue, return, in, yield 
try, except, finally, raise, assert
import, from, as, class, def, pass, global, nonlocal, lambda, del, with 



4) Statements

5) Variables

Rules for declaring a variable :

* should contain a-zA-Z0-9_
* Must not start with a digit
* Can not use a keyword as variable
* Length of the variable is not fixed

Suggestion: variable name should be precise and meaningful

Standard Input and Output in Python :

input()
print()

Note : print() always displays result in a new line. For displays result in a single line we use end="" parameter
       input() always takes string as input. For taking input a number, we use typecasting

1) print("Aptech", end=" ")
   print("learning")

2) Pre-defined methods used 
input() : takes input
print() : displays result
type()  : Gives the type of the variable
id()    : Gives the memory Address of the variable
len()   : Gives the number of characters in a string
split() : Will split a string based on a symbol

variable declaration :

1) name = "Aptech"
   num1 = 10

2) Multiple variable declaration

a = 10
b = 20 
c = 30

a, b, c = 10, 20, 30

a, b, c = 10, 1.25, "Aptech"

a, b, c = 10, 20  #error ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 3, got 2)

3) Dynamic typed variable declaration

a = 10
print(type(a))  # <class 'int'>

a = "Aptech"
print(type(a))  # <class 'str'>

4) Assigning a same value to multiple variable

a = 10
b = 10
c = 10

a, b, c = 10, 10, 10

a = b = c = 10


#Write a program to swap two variable without using third variable.


Type Casting :

It is the way to change the datatype of a variable.

1) Explicit (By force changing the datatype)
2) Implicit (By automatically)

Example :

a = 10 
print(type(a))
a = "Aptech"
print(type(a))

implicit type casting

Example :

To use explicit type casting, we must use following methods
int()
float()
str()
double()

a = "5"
print(type(a))  #<class 'str'>
a = int(a)
print(type(a)   #<class 'int'>

#Write a program to enter two numbers from keyboard and find its sum


len() :

s = "Aptech"
print(len(s)) #6


#Write a program to enter your name through keyboard and find the number of characters in it.
