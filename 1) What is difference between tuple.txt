1) What is difference between tuple and list ?

list :  It is mutable.
        We use [], list() to define a list.
        It has several built-in methods to manipulate a list.
        append(), insert(), remove(), pop()


tuple : It is immutable.
        we use (), tuple() to define a tuple.
        It has no such methods to manipulate a tuple. To manipulate         a tuple, we must use list and list methods.


2) What are the similarities between list and tuple ?

Both are ordered, indexed and can contain duplicate. Both are sequence data type.

3) Python is called Dynamic Typed language.

Why python is called a Dynamic Typed language?

In python, there is type concept i.e. we have datatype in python.
But we don't use data type explicitly while declaring a variable. It is automatically assigned when we assign a value to the variable. Hence python is called dynamic typed language.
