Control Flow :

In python control of program execution is always from top to bottom and execute line by line.

But in some cases, we have to shift our control from one place to other. In that cases we use control flow statements.

There are three types of control flow statement.

1) conditional (if, if else, if elif else)
2) transfer  (continue, break, pass)
3) iterative (for, while)
 
conditional statement : 

When we have a condition and based the value of the condition, control flow will execute some lines of code or not.


if statement : 

The if statement always has a condition. Based on the condition, some lines of code inside the block will execute or not.

syntax :

if condition:
   statement1
   statement2
   ..
   ..
   

when condition is TRUE, then statement1, statement2 and … (the lines of code inside if block) will be executed.

when condition is FALSE, then control flow will skip the lines of code inside if block.


Example : 

name = input("Enter student name : ")
if name == 'Ram':
   print('Name is :' , name)
   print("He is a python student")
   print("He scores good in python")
print("End of the program")

Every if block must have some / one line(s) of code inside it. If not, it will be error.

What is the output of the following ?

1) if 1:
     print("1")   # 1

2) if 1 is 1.0 :
     print('1 is 1.0')  # 

3) if None:
     print('None')  # 

4) if '':
     print('No output') # 


#Write a program to enter any number and print "even" if it even.
=====================================================================

if else statement : 

In this statement, we have a condition and based on condition if block (the lines of code inside if block) or else block (the lines of inside else block) will be executed.


if condition :
   statement1
   statement2
   …
   …
else :
   statement 10
   statement 11
   ….
   ….

when condition : TRUE,
       statement1, statement2 , … will execute (ie. if block will execute)
       statement10, statement11, … will be skipped (i.e else block will skip)
when condition : FALSE,
       statement1, statement2 , … will be skipped  (ie. if block will skip)
       statement10, statement11, … will be executed (i.e else block will execute)

    

Example : 

name = input("Enter student name : ")
if name == 'Ram':
   print('Name is :' , name)
   print("He is a python student")
   print("He scores good in python")
else:
   print('There is no student named : ", name)
print("End of the program")


# if elif else : 
=====================

There are more than one condition. The condition are checked one by one. If the first condition false, then next condition will be checked otherwise not.

syntax :

if conditio1 :
   statement1
   statement2
   ….
elif condition2:
   statement11
   statement12
   …
elif condition3 :
   statement21
   statement22
   ….
else
  statement31
  statement32
  ….


At first, condition1 will be checked, If it is True, then statement1, statemnet2 will be executed and rest will be skipped.
If condition1 is False, then if block will skipped and condition2 will be checked.
If condition2 is true, then statement11, statment12 will be executed and so on.

Example : 

marks = ?
45% > Pass
50% > B
60% > A
75% > E
45% < Fail

marks = int(input("Enter marks of student in % : "))

if marks>45 and marks<=60 :
   print('Pass with B Grade")
elif marks >60 and marks<75 :
   print("Pass with A grade")
elif marks>=75 :
  print("Pass with E Grade")
else :
  print("Failed or invalid % of marks")

#Write a program to print odd and even numbers between 1 and 100

for i in range(1, 101): 
  if i%2 == 0 :
    print('{} is even'.format(i))
  else :
    print('{} is odd'.format(i))

1 is odd
2 is even
3 is odd
…


even = []
odd = []

for i in range(1, 101): 
  if i%2 == 0 :
    even.append(i)
  else :
    odd.append(i)

print('even :', even)
print('odd :', odd)

even : [2 4 6 8 …]
odd : [1 3 5 7 …]



Nested if else : 
===============================

One if statement can contain another if else statement. It is nested if else 


syntax : 

   if condition1 :
      if conditon2 :
        statement1
        statement2
        …
      else:
        statement11
        statement12
        …
   else:
       statement21
       statement22
       …..




         

     


example : 

marks = int(input("Enter marks of student in % : "))

if marks>45 and marks<=100 :
  if marks <=59:
    print("Pass with A grade")
  elif marks <=74 
    print("Pass with A grade")
  else :
   print("Pass with E Grade")
else :
  print("Failed or invalid % of marks")


=====================================================

marks = int(input("Enter marks of student in % : "))

if marks>45 and marks<=100 :
  if marks <=74:
     if(marks <=59) :
       print("Pass with B grade")
     else:
       print("Pass with A grade")
  else:
    print("Pass with E grade")   

else :
  print("Failed or invalid % of marks")
