Control Flow :

In python control of program execution is always from top to bottom and execute line by line.

But in some cases, we have to shift our control from one place to other. In that cases we use control flow statements.

There are three types of control flow statement.

1) conditional (if, if else, if elif else)
2) transfer  (continue, break, pass)
3) iterative (for, while)
