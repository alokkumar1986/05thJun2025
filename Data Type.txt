Data Type : 

In python or any other programming language, the value stored in a variable must have some type or The type of the value or data stored in the variable.


1) Numeric datatype
2) Sequence datatype
3) Boolean datatype
4) Map datatype
5) Set datatype
6) Byte datatype
7) None Datatype

Numeric Datatype :

The data is always a number either a whole number or real number with fraction point and imaginary part.

int : it is always a whole number with negative part. 

float : It is always a real number with fraction point.

complex : It has a real part and an imaginary part.



Sequence Datatype : 

A variable holds multiple data in a sequence manner. Data can be of multiple types. 

string
list
tuple

string : In python, anything written within a '' (single quote) or "" (double quote) is considered as string. 

Sometime we also use ''' or """ for string.

In python, there is no char datatype, hence any character enclosed with  a single / double quote will be a string

a = 'c'
print(type(a)) # <class 'str'>
x = "Aptech Leaning"

y = '''Hi, I am your assistant.
How may I help you.
Please type your message'''

It is a sequence type. that means we can access each element using index.

x = "Aptech Learning"

print(x[-3])  #i



Slicing : 

var[start : end : step]

x = "Aptech Learning"

x[2:5] = 'tec'
x[2:5:2]  = 'tc'
x[:5]  =  "Aptec"
x[2:]  ='tech Learning'

x[2::2]  = 'tc erig'

x[-5:-2]  = 'rni'
x[:-2] = 'Aptech Learni'

x[-2:] = 'ng'
