Virtual Environment : 

It is a virtual system which is not dependent on the actual system and packages installed in the actual system.

What is the advantage of creating a virtual environment?

Generally we are working in a project in the actual environment, then all the packages will be accessible to the project. 

While deploying the project, all the packages will be bundled and size of the build file will be more. So the performance will be less.

To overcome or minimize the bundle size or maximize the performance, we create a virtual environment and install the packages required for the project. And finally build the project.
